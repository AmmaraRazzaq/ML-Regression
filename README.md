# ML-Regression

Machine Learning Project (Model Development)

Goal: Train a machine learning model using regression to predict mpg (miles/gallon) of a vehicle.              

step 1: import the data set 
 
step 2: select suitable feature variables

step 3: train model using multiple linear regression and polynomial regression of various degrees.

step 4: evaluate model using viasualization and numerical measures

step 5: choose the best model based on evaluation
